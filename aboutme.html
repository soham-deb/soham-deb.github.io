<h1>Hi!</h1>

<div class="aboutbody">
  <p>Since the age of 5, origami had been a huge part of my life, pushing myself more and more with every model. And to think that it was a coincidence that I had even heard of origami in the first place…</p>
    <p>It was during the school term, and I had taken a day off because I was ill. My father showed me a video he found in the local library, about the story of a Japanese girl named Sadako Sasaki, an atom bomb survivor from Hiroshima. According to japanese legend, folding a thousand cranes allowed you one wish to be granted. When she was eventually diagnosed with lukemia at age 11, she would fold paper cranes everyday, hoping it would cure her from the illness. I was instantly fascinated by her dedication and the craftwork, and soon began to make one myself. And finally, after days of struggle, I managed to fold the crane. From that moment, I knew this would become a lifelong passion. Soon, I would be spending hours a day surfing through Youtube to find new models to make and share with my friends and family.</p>
    <p>This passion has continued to live to the point where it is today.</p>
